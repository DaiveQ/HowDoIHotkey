# What are hotkeys?
Hotkeys, also known as keyboard shortcuts, are combinations of keys that can make performing
certain basic tasks quicker and easier. If you don't need an introdution, you can

### How do I use hotkeys?
Hotkeys are typically a combination of two or more keys.  
This consists of...

#### A modifier key
Note: If a key is on both sides, you can choose either to press.

#### (Optional) Additional modifier keys

#### A standard key (or some speical ones)

## Anything else?
#### Abbreviations
Ctrl means the control key  
Win means the windows key  

#### Mac OS Users
The hotkeys on this page are designed for use on Windows. These will likely
be the same on Mac OS, but with a different modifier key; Typically this
means using Command (&#8984;) instead of Ctrl. Future versions of this
website may include Mac OS's version of the hotkey along side Windows'.

#### Additional modifier: Shift
Often times, shift is used as an additional modifer key. This typically performs
a similar action to the hotkey without shift, but does something a little different
or does the reverse of it. One example is how **Ctrl + F** is find, but
**Ctrl + Shift + F** is find and replace. I don't go over all of these so feel
free to try them for yourself (you can search online if you're unsure about one).

#### Application specific hotkeys
Many of these hotkeys work everywhere or most places, but there are some hotkeys
which depend on the application. When this is the case, I'll add a little "where"
section to tell you where they are typically accepted, but it isn't all inclusive
or without exceptions. If you don't know if a hotkey works in your application,
try it and see for yourself. You can always search it up if you are having troubles.

## Final words
For hotkeys to go through properly, always hold down the modifier key first and then
press the standard key. This can be done near simultaniously so don't worry about waiting
between presses, but if the standard key is pressed first, the hotkey won't go through.

Besides that, remember, these hotkeys are here to help you. If you don't find a hotkey useful,
there is no pressure to use them. In addition, if you find the amount of hotkeys
overwhelming, feel free to just focus on what you find the most useful. You can
always come back here or search online if you want to learn some more hotkeys.

instead which will keep the menu open so you only need to press **Tab** to cycle
