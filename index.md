Hotkeys are typically a combination of two or more keys.  
This includes:

#### A modifier key

# What do I need to know?
Firstly, the hotkeys on this page are designed for use on Windows. These will
likely be the same on Mac OS, but with a different modifier key; Typically this
is Command (&#8984;) instead of Control (Ctrl). In the future, I may show the
Mac OS version of hotkeys along side the Windows one.
