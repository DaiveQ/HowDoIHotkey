# What if I'm on Mac OS?
The hotkeys on this page are designed for use on Windows. These will likely
be the same on Mac OS, but with a different modifier key; Typically this
means using Command (&#8984;) instead of Control (Ctrl). Future versions of this
website may include Mac OS's version of the hotkey along side Windows'.
