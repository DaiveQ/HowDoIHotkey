# What are hotkeys?
Hotkeys, also known as keyboard shortcuts, are combinations of keys that can make performing
certain basic tasks quicker and easier. If you don't need an introduction, you can
[skip to the hotkeys](#im-ready-for-the-hotkeys). Otherwise, continue reading for an introduction.

### Scenario: You want to copy all of the text on a document and paste it somewhere else
#### Without Hotkeys:

1. Go to top of page  
2. Press and hold the mouse button from beginning of text (begin selecting/highlighting text)
3. Drag mouse down to bottom of screen   
4. Wait for the page to finish scrolling to bottom of the text (to highlight everything)
5. Right click mouse (open the context menu)  
6. Press copy (copy all text)  
7. Go to where you want to paste the text  
8. Right click mouse (open the context menu)  
9. Press paste (paste the copied text)  

**Task completed in 9 steps**

#### With Hotkeys:

1. Press Control and A (select/highlight all text)
2. Press Control and C (copy selected text)
3. Go to where you want to paste the text
4. Press Control and V (paste the copied text)

**Task completed in 4 steps**

### How do I use hotkeys?
Hotkeys are typically a combination of two or more keys.  
This consists of...

#### A modifier key
Note: If a key is on both sides, you can choose either to press.

#### (Optional) Additional modifier keys

#### A standard key (or some speical ones)

## Anything else?
#### Abbreviations
Ctrl means the control key  
Win means the windows key  

#### Mac OS Users
The hotkeys on this page are designed for use on Windows. These will likely
be the same on Mac OS, but with a different modifier key; Typically this
means using Command (&#8984;) instead of Ctrl. Future versions of this
website may include Mac OS's version of the hotkey along side Windows'.

#### Additional modifier: Shift
Often times, shift is used as an additional modifier key. This typically performs
a similar action to the hotkey without shift, but does something a little different
or does the reverse of it. One example is how **Ctrl + F** is find, but
**Ctrl + Shift + F** is find and replace. I don't go over all of these so feel
free to try them for yourself (you can search online if you're unsure about one).

#### Application specific hotkeys
Many of these hotkeys work everywhere or most places, but there are some hotkeys
which depend on the application. When this is the case, I'll add a little "where"
section to tell you where they are typically accepted, but it isn't all inclusive
or without exceptions. If you don't know if a hotkey works in your application,
try it and see for yourself. You can always search it up if you are having troubles.

## Final words
For hotkeys to go through properly, always hold down the modifier key first and then
press the standard key. This can be done near simultaneously so don't worry about waiting
between presses, but if the standard key is pressed first, the hotkey won't go through.  
&nbsp;

Besides that, remember, these hotkeys are here to help you. If you don't find a hotkey useful,
there is no pressure to use them. In addition, if you find the amount of hotkeys
overwhelming, feel free to just focus on what you find the most useful. You can
always come back here or search online if you want to learn some more hotkeys.

## The Vitals
#### Copy & Paste (& Cut)

##### Hotkey to copy: Ctrl + C
This allows you to copy whatever you have selected to a "virtual clipboard" which
is used in conjunction with **Ctrl + V**.  
**Tip to remember:** **C** stands for "Copy"
![](/KeyboardImages/copy.svg)

##### Hotkey to paste: Ctrl + V
This allows you to insert/paste anything from your clipboard onto what
you're currently doing (e.g., into a document).  
Tip to Remember: '**V**' is right next to '**C**' and you paste after you copy
![](/KeyboardImages/paste.svg)

##### Hotkey to cut: Ctrl + X
Instead of copying something, this hotkey copies it to your clipboard and deletes it.
Useful for when you want to move some text in a document.  
**Tip to remember:** '**X**' can be seen as open scissors.
It is also next to copy and paste as they are all related.
![](/KeyboardImages/cut.svg)

##### Hotkey to see clipboard history: Win + V
**Windows 10 Exclusive hotkey**  
This hotkey is similar to **Ctrl + V**, but it allows you to see your clipboard history
and paste something from there. Useful when you need to copy more than one thing or
accidently copy and overwrite something on your clipboard that you needed. May need to
be enabled in Windows Settings.  
**Tip to remember:** Same as **Ctrl + V**, but with **Win** instead.
![](/KeyboardImages/clip_hist.svg)

#### The Life Savers
##### Hotkey to undo: Ctrl + Z
This undoes whatever you just did. Accidently deleted an essay you were writing for the past hour?
Slap it with a **Ctrl + Z** and you should get everything back.  
**Tip to Remember:** Not much. You could try thinking of it as the closest key to (left) **Ctrl** because it is your closest friend/most useful hotkey.
![](/KeyboardImages/undo.svg)

##### Hotkey to redo: Ctrl + Y
This re-does anything you just undid. Useful when you accidently **Ctrl + Z** too many times.
Be warned that writing anything after you **Ctrl + Z** will make you unable to redo.
**Tip to remember**: Not much again. You could try thinking of it as the letter that comes before
**Z** in **Ctrl + Z**.
![](/KeyboardImages/redo.svg)
Note: If this doesn't work, try **Ctrl + Shift + Z**, but this is uncommon outside of
some more technical programs.

##### Hotkey to save: Ctrl + S
Saves changes to the current document. Useful when you quickly want to make sure you don't to lose your work on a file. You only need to press it once, but some people like to press it multiple times
just to be sure.  
**Tip to remember:** **S** stands for "Save"
![](/KeyboardImages/save_file.svg)
**Where: Anywhere where files are edited**

## The Very Usefuls
#### Find
##### Hotkey to find: Ctrl + F
Lets you find/search some text on a page/document. Useful on large (and small) documents when
you want to find something quickly.  
**Tip to remember:** **F** stands for "Find."
![](/KeyboardImages/find_text.svg)
**Where: Browser, file readers, text editors**

#### Cycle open windows
##### Hotkey to cycle windows: Alt + Tab
Lets you go through your open windows to bring the one you want to the front.
**Guide:** While holding down **Alt**, continue to press **Tab** until the window you want to
focus is selected and release the keys. You can also use **Ctrl + Alt + Tab**
instead which will keep the menu open so you only need to press **Tab** to cycle
and **Enter** to select.  
**Tip to remember:** Can't think of anything. Try using it a lot to remember.
![](/KeyboardImages/cycle_open_windows.svg)

##### Hotkey to cycle windows backwards: Alt + Shift + Tab
Same as **Alt + Tab**, but cycles through the windows in the reverse order. Similarly, when
using **Ctrl + Alt + Tab**, you can use **Shift + Tab** to go in reverse order.  
**Tip to remember:** **Shift** is modifier of hotkeys and this is a modified version of **Ctrl + Alt + Tab**.
![](/KeyboardImages/cycle_open_windows_backwards.svg)

#### Browser tabs
##### Hotkey to open new tab: Ctrl + T
Opens a new tab in your browser. Works in some more advanced text editors as well.  
**Tip to remember:** **T** stands for "Tab."
![](/KeyboardImages/new_tab.svg)

##### Hotkey to reopen closed tab: Ctrl + Shift + T
Reopens the last tab you closed. Can be used multiple times to open older tabs.  
**Tip to remember:**  **Shift** is modifier of hotkeys and this is modified version of **Ctrl + T**.
![](/KeyboardImages/restore_closed_tab.svg)

#### Deletion
##### Delete a whole word before the text cursor: Ctrl + Backspace
Deletes a whole word before the text cursor. This sometimes doesn't work and
will add a blank or square character. I don't know what the purpose of that is, but
I don't like it.  
**Tip to remember:** Modified version of **Backspace**
![](/KeyboardImages/backspace_word.svg)

##### Delete a whole word after the text cursor: Ctrl + Delete
If you haven't used it before, the delete key deletes a character after the text
cursor normally. This hotkey deleted an entire word after the text cursor.  
**Tip to remember:** Modified version of **Delete**.
![](/KeyboardImages/delete_word.svg)

## The Nice To Knows
#### Text Selection
##### Hotkey to continuously select text: Shift + Arrow Key
Continuously selects text. You can also use the opposite direction to deselect some text.  
**Tip to remember:**  Modified version of the **Arrow Keys**.
![](/KeyboardImages/select_text.svg)
Can also use **Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Key** to select entire words

##### Hotkey to select all text: Ctrl + A
Selects all text on a browser page or document.  
**Tip to Remember:** **A** stands for "All."
![](/KeyboardImages/select_all.svg)

##### Hotkey to select entire word
This isn't a hotkey, but if you double click on a word with your mouse, you can
select the entire word. If you hold the second click, you can drag your mouse
and continue selecting per word (similar to how clicking and dragging continuously selects per character).

#### Screenshot
##### Hotkey to open screenshot menu: Win + Shift + S
**Windows 10 Exclusive**
This hotkey opens a screenshot menu with multiple options to screenshot (play around with them).  
**Tip to remember:** **S** stands for "Screenshot." **Shift** is added to this hotkey because
**Win + S** is already taken by opening the start menu.
